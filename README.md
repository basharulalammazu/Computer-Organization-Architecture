## 🛠 How to Run the Code

To run the 8086 assembly programs, you’ll need an emulator or development environment that supports the Intel 8086 architecture.

### ✅ Recommended Tools

- **[EMU8086](http://www.emu8086.com/)** – All-in-one IDE and emulator for 8086 Assembly.
- **[DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/)** – DOS emulator for running legacy applications.
- **MASM / TASM** – Assemblers for compiling `.asm` files to executables.

### ⚙️ Steps to Execute

1. **Install a Tool**  
   Choose EMU8086, DOSBox, or MASM/TASM.

2. **Assemble the Code**  
   Use an assembler (e.g., EMU8086's built-in compiler or MASM) to compile the `.asm` file.

3. **Link the Code** *(if required)*  
   Use a linker to produce an executable (`.exe` or `.com`) file (mainly for MASM/TASM users).

4. **Run the Program**  
   Execute the binary file within your chosen emulator or IDE.

> 📖 Refer to each tool's documentation for detailed installation and usage instructions.
