# 🖥️ Computer Organization and Architecture – 8086 Assembly Code Solutions

This repository contains a curated collection of **8086 assembly language programs** developed as part of the coursework for the **Computer Organization and Architecture** course at **American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB)**. The programs aim to enhance foundational understanding of low-level programming and microprocessor architecture, specifically using the **Intel 8086** instruction set.

## 🛠 How to Run the Code

To execute these 8086 assembly programs, you will need an emulator or development tool that supports 8086 architecture.

### ✅ Recommended Tools

- **EMU8086** – An all-in-one IDE and emulator for 8086 Assembly.
- **DOSBox** – A DOS emulator for running legacy applications and executables.
- **MASM / TASM** – Assemblers used to convert `.asm` files into executable programs.

### ⚙️ Steps to Execute

1. **Install an Emulator or IDE**  
   Recommended: [EMU8086](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/) or [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/)

2. **Assemble the Code**  
   Use an assembler (e.g., MASM/TASM) or EMU8086’s built-in compiler to compile `.asm` files.

3. **Link the Code** *(if using MASM/TASM)*  
   Generate an `.exe` or `.com` file using a compatible linker.

4. **Run the Program**  
   Use your chosen emulator or IDE to execute the assembled binary.

> For emulator-specific guidance, refer to the official documentation provided with your tool.
